<h1> Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself? </h1>

The point of this project was to create a the logic for the pirate treasure hunter. I developed the code for the Q-training algorithm.

<h1> Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science: </h1>
<h2> What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? </h2>
Computer scientists study computers and create systems, applications, and more with those computers. These computers can vary from a super computer at NASA to a humble coffee maker in your kitchen.

<h2> How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? </h2>
I approach every problem with gathering as much information as possible. It is very important to have the requirements down and understood before starting any type of problem. A problem that may arise can be solved by following logic steps and error codes (usually). This is done by following the computers logic when seeing error codes. For example, if there is a problem with my class importing, I know that my computer is telling me "Hey, I cannot import this" and I need to follow the logical steps to solve this problem. 

<h2> What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? </h2>
My ethnical responsibilities is to never try to harm anyone with a product or system that I create or take part in.
